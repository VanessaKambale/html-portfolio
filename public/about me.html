<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Vanessa Nzuva Kambale, am a very kind, cheerful and someone who gets along easily with everyone, I am very ambitious, hard-working and a determine person who enjoys working with others as part of a team.</p> <p> I am an aspiring web developer soon to be the best web developer out there!</p> I love learning new skills, I used to work in sales, but I was not feeling fulfilled in that field so I decided to change my career and become more a technical person than a salesperson and challenge myself a bit more.</p> I took on this new course on Udemy by Angela Yu and so far I love what I am learning everyday! and sometimes I asked myself why didn't I change my career sooner!? I hope to continue learning and become a great at it! and share my work and knowledge with others.</p>
